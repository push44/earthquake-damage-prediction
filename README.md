## Problem statement:
According to Wikipwdia The April 2015 Nepal earthquake killed nearly 9,000 people and injured nearly 22,000. It occurred at 11:56 Nepal Standard Time on 25 April 2015, with a magnitude of 7.8Mw. But in this project we try to predict the building damage grade that are classified in three categories.
<ol>
  <li>Low damage</li>
  <li>Medium damage</li>
  <li>Complete destriction</li>
</ol>
